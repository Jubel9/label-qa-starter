# Quality notes
- κ on 800 items (two independent passes): 0.967 — most disagreements ham↔unclear.
- Spam stayed clean due to strong prize/CTA/shortcode/pricing cues.
- To reduce ham↔unclear, add explicit guidance for short replies beyond “ok/thanks” and define signs of truncation (“…”) vs. stylistic ellipses.
